### Danish Administrative Data 

Please separately cite each register that would be required to replicate your analysis if data access was granted. 

A list of all registers can be found here: http://www.dst.dk/extranet/forskningvariabellister/Oversigt%20over%20registre.html.

An example:  

> Statistics Denmark (2020). "Befolkningen (BEF, Population Demographics), 1985-2011 [database]". Danmarks Statistiks Forskningsservice, accessed (xxx).


where the "author" is Statistics Denmark, but the "publisher" is the research service of Statistics Denmark. You should note the version. In the manuscript, you would then cite "Statistics Denmark (2020)" in the text where you describe the data. 

The README can point to the codebook for each register, e.g., https://www.dst.dk/extranet/ForskningVariabellister/BEF%20-%20Befolkningen.html for BEF. 

We note that the purpose of proper citation is meant to clarify the sources of the information you used, in this case from a database, and identify its version; it may also help to disambiguate - for instance, if there are other databases containing similar information.
